What is Maze:
It is a Maze game written in python, with the implementation
of Depth-First search and Tkinter (a python GUI library).

This program contains two file, 'gamepanel.py' handling the GUI,
and 'maze.py' generates the maze, etc.

The maze is designed to be hard to solve:
1. A lot of interesection
2. Only the maze within 2 blocks is visulize to player

However, we don't want to make you upset. The program will
randomly generate a 'red block' aka 'coin path' to show your
way out.

You may config the row, column size, and the time that the
'coin path' will last for before you start the game.


How to play:
1. download the file, unzip it
2. run '$ python3 gameplanel.py' to start the game
3. you may config the row and column size, and
how long will the coin path(bonus) last for
4. click 'New Game' then use your keyboard to play
5. have fun:)
