What is Maze:
It is a Maze game written in python, with the implementation
of Depth-First search and Tkinter (a python GUI library).

This program contains two file, 'gamepanel.py' handling the GUI,
and 'maze.py' generates the maze, etc.

The maze is designed to be hard to solve:
1. A lot of interesection
2. Only the maze within 2 blocks is visulize to player

However, we don't want to make you upset. The program will
randomly generate a 'red block' aka 'coin path' to show your
way out.

You may config the row, column size, and the time that the
'coin path' will last for before you start the game.

maze.py
1. create a two dimension array, '0' -> path, '1' -> wall, '7' -> exit

make_rwo():
Implememnt DFS to create a map. The entrance point is placed at
stack in the first place. When the stack is not empty, take
one point out and mark as visited. Then, we generate a random adj
point which is within the map and haven't been visited yet. And the,
we create a path between them.

get_next_point():
get a random point near the argu - 'p'(point p)

get_around():
get a point at x, y in certain directoin in certain distance

solve():
find a path from current point to the exit

gamepanel.py
light_block():
determine which block is visiualize to the player or not


How to play:
1. download the file, unzip it
2. run '$ python3 gameplanel.py' to start the game
3. you may config the row and column size, and
how long will the coin path(bonus) last for
4. click 'New Game' then use your keyboard to play
5. 'red' block is the bonus, 'green' point is the exit
5. have fun:)
